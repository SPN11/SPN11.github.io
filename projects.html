	<h2>PantherView</h2>
	<p> PantherView is a collaborative Computer Science Club Project in HTML, CSS, and Javascript utilizing Leaflet.js with OpenStreetMap.<br>
	Retrieves data from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center such as arrest and code violation records as well as data from a <br>
	custom Pitt API (written in Python, hosted as a Flask application on AWS). The data is then organized into filterable pins that are <br>
	placed on a map to show locations of incident records, or information about Pitt services.<br></p>
