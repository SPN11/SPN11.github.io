	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>My name is Sam Nigh, and I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh Main Campus pursuing a bachelor's
    	degree in computer science and a minor in italian studies.
    	I grew up in the Greater Pittsburgh Area and have always called Pittsburgh my home, as well as a home to the arts, industry,
    	and cutting-edge technology. <br>
    	I am well-versed with object-oriented programming in Java, but I am primarily interested in
	system management, system software, and embedded systems development with GNU/Linux. In
	particular, I am interested in device driver and kernel module development. I am most
	familiar with the Debian distro of GNU/Linux.
