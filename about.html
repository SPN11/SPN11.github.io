	<h1>Hello!</h1>
	<p>My name is Sam Nigh, and I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh Main Campus pursuing a bachelor's <br>
		degree in computer science and a minor in italian studies. <br>
    I grew up in the Greater Pittsburgh Area and have always called Pittsburgh my home, as well as a home to the arts, industry, <br>
    and cutting-edge technology including but not limited to Uber ATG, the leaders in self-driving cars. <br> <br>
    I am well-versed with object-oriented programming conceptually and with languages such as Java and C++. I am also proficient in C.
