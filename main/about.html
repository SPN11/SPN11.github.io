	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p class="indent">My name is Sam Nigh, and I am a junior at the University of Pittsburgh Main Campus pursuing a bachelor's
    	degree in computer science and a minor in italian studies.
    	I grew up in the Greater Pittsburgh Area and have always called Pittsburgh my home, as well as a home to the arts, industry,
    	and cutting-edge technology.</p>
    	<p class="indent">I am well-versed with object-oriented programming in Java, but I am primarily interested in
		system management, embedded systems development with GNU/Linux, and DevOps practices. </p>
	<p class="indent">I am currently an officer in Pitt's Computer Science Club as the Events Coordinator,
		responsible for helping members be engaged in the club, organize social events, and reach
		out to and coordinate with other organizations in the area for events and workshops. </p>
    <p class="indent"><b>My anticipated graduation date is April 2018</b>, and I am actively seeking for an entry level position in software development, software engineering, embedded systems, or software infrastructure and DevOps in the Greater Pittsburgh Area. </p>
